### Fix 3: Check If You're in Codespaces/Cloud IDE

I notice from your terminal that you're using **GitHub Codespaces** (`@v41nw7jl`). The 403 error might be due to Codespaces permissions.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure your Codespace port 8501 is set to **Public**:
   - In Codespaces, go to "PORTS" tab (bottom panel)
   - Find port 8501
   - Right-click → Change Port Visibility → **Public**

2. Or try accessing via the **External URL** shown in your terminal:
```
   External URL: http://20.192.21.52:8501
